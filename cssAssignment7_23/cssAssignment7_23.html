        <h2>Gentoo Penguin :-)</h2>
        <p>The Gentoo Penguin is the fastest penguin in the world.  It was first discovered in 1781.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>The origin of the name "Gentoo" is unknown, as the source of the name could have come from 
        multiple places.  They are the third largest penguin and have an operating system named after
        them called Gentoo.  It's my favorite animal because there's an OS named after it, and penguins
        in general are heavily associated with Linux.</p>
